# Top Popular Apps Built With React Native

## Introduction

React Native is one of the most popular frameworks for developing native apps for Android and iOS. It was developed by the Facebook team as a modern solution for developing native (or, more specifically, native-like) apps for multiple platforms with one codebase. It is a JavaScript-based framework specifically used in the development of applications for two prominent platforms – Android & iOS.

React Native application development gained widespread popularity due to its versatility to help developers cross-platform apps with one codebase.

It is built on top of Facebook’s React JS library, with the enhanced capability to develop native apps. The speed at which applications can be developed is a crucial factor nowadays. React keeps up with the current fast-paced era of app development. Therefore React Native development has gained widespread popularity, making it the second most used framework in recent times.

Bloomberg used it a long back in 2016, with the launch of a revamped app for iOS and Android platforms. The company employed React Native to introduce features such as personalized content, videos, and live feeds.

Before React Native, Bloomberg teams “would have developed the iOS and Android versions in parallel without being able to share most of the code they wrote, leading to delays and repetition,” Lew explains. By comparison, the React Native platform’s unified development capabilities made for a seamless process that allowed each developer to focus on one feature at a time.

**2. Facebook**

Facebook is the world’s most popular social media platform that connects users across the globe and allows them to interact with each other.

It is obvious Facebook would use it as it developed it. Initially, Facebook developed it for the iOS platform to implement modern web techniques in the mobile app. Sooner after a few months, the company released it for Android app development, making it a cross-platform technology.

Facebook ads manager is entirely built using React Native, while the company used native code and React Native JavaScript in its Facebook Group app.

**3. Discord**

To make their mobile app more efficient
To develop the app in less time
To develop the significant part of the app using single code (the team shares over 95% of the business logic codebase for iOS and Android)
To build a scalable application
The Wix app has undergone several changes, and a large number of features were added within a short period of time, leveraging React Native.
