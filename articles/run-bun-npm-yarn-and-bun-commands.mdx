Bun is designed to start fast and run fast.

Under the hood, Bun uses the JavaScriptCore engine, which Apple develops for Safari. In most cases, the startup and running performance is faster than V8, the engine used by Node.js and Chromium-based browsers. Its transpiler and runtime are written in Zig, a modern, high-performance language. On Linux, this translates into startup times 4x faster than Node.js.

> If you want to get rid of all those different commands on each package manager I highly recommend installing SWPM and saying goodbye to package manager confusion. It will do all the command translations for you.

This is a command guide for the npm (Node Package Manager), and yarn (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), to bun (JavaScript runtime).

> Note: `<package>` follow this structure `<package[@latest|@#.#.#]>`
